# Ryver App

This is the README for your Ryver app. Follow the instructions below to set up Prisma with Bun server for your project.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following prerequisites installed on your system:

- **Node.js:** Prisma requires Node.js to run certain generation commands. Ensure that Node.js is installed in your environment.

## Initializing Prisma with Bun

1. Create a new directory for your project and navigate to it:

   ```bash
   mkdir ryver-app
   cd ryver-app
   ```

2. Initialize your project with Bun:

   ```bash
   bun init
   ```

3. Install Prisma CLI (prisma) and Prisma Client (@prisma/client) using Bun:

   ```bash
   bun add prisma @prisma/client
   ```

## Setting Up the Prisma Schema

1. Initialize the Prisma schema and migration directory with an in-memory SQLite database for simplicity:

   ```bash
   bunx prisma init --datasource-provider sqlite
   ```

2. Modify the `prisma/schema.prisma` file to define your data models (similar to the User model in the example provided).

## Running Migrations

1. Generate and run the initial migration by running the following command:

   ```bash
   bunx prisma migrate dev --name init
   ```

   This command will create a `.sql` migration file in the `prisma/migrations` directory and execute the migration against a new SQLite instance.

## Regenerating Prisma Client

Prisma Client is automatically regenerated whenever a new migration is executed. However, you can manually regenerate the client if needed:

```bash
bunx prisma generate
```

## Using Prisma Client in Your Application

Import and use the generated Prisma Client in your application from `@prisma/client`. You can now interact with your database using Prisma Client.

## Sample Script

A sample script is provided that demonstrates how to create a new user and count the number of users in the database. You can run the script with the following command:

```bash
bun run index.ts
```

## Continuing Development

For further development and to learn more about using Prisma, refer to the official Prisma documentation.
