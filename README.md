# Rythm | 3D Price Action Dashboard

> Rythm stands as a groundbreaking computational tool, transforming conventional market data into an immersive three-dimensional (3D) landscape. It's not just a tool; it's a revolutionary way to experience and interpret market dynamics, offering a novel, multi-dimensional view that goes beyond traditional analysis.\*\*

## Key Features

### 3D Visualization

Rythm leverages 3D visualization to revolutionize market data representation. Unlike traditional 2D time-series graphs, it constructs a dynamic 3D spatial format. This 3D perspective is particularly advantageous for capturing price movements across different scales, from subtle fluctuations to major market trends. The added dimension is used for multi-trend identification and pattern recognition.

### Range-based Representation

One of Rythm's defining features is its range-based representation of price movements. This method transcends traditional time-bound charts by assigning each price movement, regardless of its scale. This approach enhances pattern recognition by providing a direct and spatial representation of price behavior without time.

### Accurate Trend Analysis

Rythm's range-based representation serves as a precise lens for analyzing market trends. It empowers users to dissect price behavior at different scales, providing a nuanced understanding of trend strength and direction. This level of accuracy enhances the reliability of trend analysis and fosters more effective trading strategies.

## Code Style and Formatting Guidelines

### Function Comment Format

To maintain clarity and consistency in our codebase, we follow a structured format for commenting functions. This ensures that each function is adequately described, making the codebase more readable and maintainable.

#### Large Function Comment Example

For more complex or significant functions, use the following comment structure:

```typescript
/**
 * Brief description of the function's purpose.
 * @param {ParamType} paramName - Description of the parameter.
 * @param {ParamType} anotherParamName - Description of another parameter.
 * @returns {ReturnType} Description of what the function returns.
 */
function functionName(paramName, anotherParamName) {
   // Function implementation
}
```

For simple functions that you think require some explanation, use the following comment structure:

```typescript
// Brief description of the function
function smallFunction(param) {
   // Function implementation
}
```

## Prettier Configuration

Our project includes a .prettierrc file at the root, defining specific formatting rules. Prettier will automatically use this configuration when run. Please do not modify this file unless there is a consensus about the change.

# Ryver App

This is the README for your Ryver app. Follow the instructions below to set up Prisma with Bun server for your project.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following prerequisites installed on your system:

-  **Node.js:** Prisma requires Node.js to run certain generation commands. Ensure that Node.js is installed in your environment.

## Initializing Prisma with Bun

1. cd directory:

   ```bash
   cd ryver
   ```
````

2. Initialize your project with Bun:

   ```bash
   bun init
   ```

   ```bash
   bun install
   ```

3. Install Prisma CLI (prisma) and Prisma Client (@prisma/client) using Bun:

   ```bash
   bun add prisma @prisma/client
   ```

## Setting Up the Prisma Schema

1. Initialize the Prisma schema and migration directory with an in-memory SQLite database for simplicity:

   ```bash
   bunx prisma init --datasource-provider sqlite
   ```

## Regenerating Prisma Client

```bash
bunx prisma generate
```

## Using Prisma Client in Your Application

Import and use the generated Prisma Client in your application from `@prisma/client`. You can now interact with your database using Prisma Client.

## Sample Script

now You can run ryver with the following command:

```bash
bun run dev
```

## Continuing Development

For further development and to learn more about using Prisma, refer to the official Prisma documentation.
